### hi, i’m poojitha 🤸🏻‍♀️

i like making things that are useful, calm, and a little bit clever.

started in testing, now slowly building my way through development, cloud, and a bit of ai.  
curious about how things work — and how to make them better.  

learning full stack, building mini tools, and eventually, maybe something with robots 🤖

mostly here to learn, build, and enjoy the process.
