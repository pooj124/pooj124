### 🤸🏻‍♀️🌱✨ Heyaaa!!

I like building things that are practical, thoughtfully designed, and quietly powerful.

started in testing, now exploring the other side — development, cloud, and a bit of ai.  
curious about how systems work, and how to make them simpler, smoother, and more intentional.  

currently learning full stack, building small tools, and slowly exploring robotics and edge tech 🤖

mostly here to learn, build, and enjoy the process.
